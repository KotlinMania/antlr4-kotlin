     * to a single cached copy. This cache is shared across all contexts
     * in all ATNConfigs in all DFA states.  We rebuild each ATNConfigSet
     * to use only cached nodes/graphs in addDFAState(). We don't want to
     * fill this during closure() since there are lots of contexts that
     * pop up but are not used ever again. It also greatly slows down closure().
     *
     *
     * This cache makes a huge difference in memory and a little bit in speed.
     * For the Java grammar on java.*, it dropped the memory requirements
     * at the end from 25M to 16M. We don't store any of the full context
     * graphs in the DFA because they are limited to local context only,
     * but apparently there's a lot of repetition there as well. We optimize
     * the config contexts before storing the config set in the DFA states
     * by literally rebuilding them with cached subgraphs only.
     *
     *
     * I tried a cache for use during closure operations, that was
     * whacked after each adaptivePredict(). It cost a little bit
     * more time I think and doesn't save on the overall footprint
     * so it's not worth the complexity.
