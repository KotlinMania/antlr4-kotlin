/** A rule context is a record of a single rule invocation.
 *
 * We form a stack of these context objects using the parent
 * pointer. A parent pointer of null indicates that the current
 * context is the bottom of the stack. The ParserRuleContext subclass
 * as a children list so that we can turn this data structure into a
 * tree.
 *
 * The root node always has a null pointer and invokingState of -1.
 *
 * Upon entry to parsing, the first invoked rule function creates a
 * context object (a subclass specialized for that rule such as
 * SContext) and makes it the root of a parse tree, recorded by field
 * Parser._ctx.
 *
 * public final SContext s() throws RecognitionException {
 * SContext _localctx = new SContext(_ctx, getState()); <-- create new node
 * enterRule(_localctx, 0, RULE_s);                     <-- push it
 * ...
 * exitRule();                                          <-- pop back to _localctx
 * return _localctx;
 * }
 *
 * A subsequent rule invocation of r from the start rule s pushes a
 * new context object for r whose parent points at s and use invoking
 * state is the state with r emanating as edge label.
 *
 * The invokingState fields from a context object to the root
 * together form a stack of rule indication states where the root
 * (bottom of the stack) has a -1 sentinel value. If we invoke start
 * symbol s then call r1, which calls r2, the  would look like
 * this:
 *
 * SContext[-1]   <- root node (bottom of the stack)
 * R1Context[p]   <- p in rule s called r1
 * R2Context[q]   <- q in rule r1 called r2
 *
 * So the top of the stack, _ctx, represents a call to the current
 * rule and it holds the return address from another rule that invoke
 * to this rule. To invoke a rule, we must always have a current context.
 *
 * The parent contexts are useful for computing lookahead sets and
 * getting error information.
 *
 * These objects are used during parsing and prediction.
 * For the special case of parsers, we use the subclass
 * ParserRuleContext.
